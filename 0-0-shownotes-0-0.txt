20 Worst Date Places

Jon - Your Parent’s House
"You’ll love them! Just ignore my mom asking when we're giving her grandkids."

Kitty - The DMV
"Nothing says romance like fluorescent lights, angry old people, and a vision test."

J - An Escape Room… Alone
"We're trapped in a room with a ticking clock and trust issues. Great start."

K - Your Ex’s Birthday Party
"It’s not weird. We’re all adults here. And also drunk."

J - A Funeral
"You look amazing in black… but maybe not next to a casket."

K - Timeshare Presentation
"We get a free blender… after three hours of financial gaslighting!"

J - Your Basement
"It's not a dungeon. It's a vibe. Don’t mind the swords and anime posters."

K - A Protest You Don't Understand
"So are we pro-ferrets or… wait, why are people yelling?"

J - Laser Hair Removal Appointment
"Nothing brings people closer than the smell of burnt leg hair."

K - Your High School Reunion
"Let’s spend the night impressing people we hated ten years ago."

J - The Local Dump
"No, babe, this is where I found our dinner table. Sentimental, right?"

K - Your Therapist’s Office
"I thought we could both unpack my emotional trauma together."

J - Open Mic Night (That You're In)
"I’m not saying I’m funny, but you’re contractually obligated to laugh."

K - IKEA on a Saturday
"Aisles of arguments, broken dreams, and meatballs."

J - Haunted House (When You’re the Screamer)
"She wanted a thrill… not to carry you out crying."

K - Your Gaming Setup
"No, babe, it’s fine. I’ll totally talk to you between Warzone matches."

J - Your Job
"Romance over the fryers at Arby’s isn’t exactly The Notebook."

K - Court (Even If You’re Not on Trial)
"‘Date night’ should not include metal detectors or subpoenas."

J - A Furry Convention Without Warning
"You told her it was cosplay. Now she's being stalked by a giant raccoon named Blade."

K - Taco Bell… on the Way to a Silent Yoga Retreat
"Let’s just say it’s going to be a very loud, very spiritual experience."
