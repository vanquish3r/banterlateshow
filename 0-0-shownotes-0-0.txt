===============================================

Tiny Triumphs

- Everyone shares a small win from their week. Even silly ones count. It builds energy and gives the audience a chance to interact right away.

-----------------------------------------------

The Plot Twist Game

Start reading out the generated story prompt, then once the story "starts", the audience can yell out PLOT TWIST at any point, and the story has to take a turn.

Back and forth I'll start, then each "plot twist" the narratory will switch.

---

You log into Banter like it’s just a normal night. Same friends, same rooms, same chaos. But when you open your menu, there’s a new world listed at the very top that you definitely didn’t add. It’s called “You Were Invited.”

No thumbnail. No description. Just that title.

Most people would ignore it, but of course you click it because self control is for other people. The screen loads… and you spawn in a world that looks exactly like the Banter home hub except something is slightly off. The lighting is too perfect. The room is too quiet. And at the center of the floor there’s a glowing circle with three words floating above it:

“Someone here is not who you think.”

Nobody else in the world has a username above their head. Everyone looks familiar but you can’t tell who anybody is. They all move and talk like normal but there’s no names, no tags, no clues. Someone in this room invited you here for a reason… and someone in the room doesn’t belong.

That’s where the story begins.

------------------------------------------------

60 Second Debate

We debate each other, 60 seconds each on the following topics:

Cereal Is (Dutch)/Isn't (kitty) Soup -

Toothpaste should taste like candy (kitty) vs. toothpaste must remain minty and serious (Dutch)

Spiders are secret terror agents (Dutch) vs. spiders are adorable (kitty)

Shoes are mandatory at all times (kitty) vs. shoes are optional for civilized life (Dutch)

------------------------------------------------

Guess The Player

We describe people in positive and funny ways, audiences guesses who we're describing.

-------------------------------------------------

Red Flag Bingo

Call out red flags and see who identifies, how many per flag.

--

You’ve said you’re leaving and then stayed another two hours.

You put off replying to texts for days… then reply with a single emoji.

You own more avatars than you’ll ever use.

You’ve invited someone to a space just to watch them figure it out themselves.

You’ve convinced yourself you’ll start tomorrow… every day.

You’ve stayed in bed scrolling for hours even though you had plans.

You’ve said “I’m five minutes away” while still at home.

You’ve eaten something that fell on the floor because “it’s still fine.”

You’ve nodded along in a conversation even though you weren’t listening.

You’ve tried to be productive… then got distracted by literally anything.
