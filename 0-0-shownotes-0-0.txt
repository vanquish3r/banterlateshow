Hockey Break

When people talk about the “Original Six” in hockey, they’re talking about the six teams that made up the NHL from 1942 to 1967—a full 25 years before the league expanded.

Those six were:
*Montreal Canadiens – the oldest team, founded in 1909, with the most Stanley Cups in history.
*Toronto Maple Leafs – their rivals, who haven’t won since 1967, but hey, history counts and they're still bigger winners than I am.
*Boston Bruins – the first American NHL team, founded in 1924.
*Chicago Blackhawks –  1926, with one of the most iconic logos in sports.
*Detroit Red Wings – Hockeytown, USA. Known for legends like Gordie Howe and the octopus tradition. octopus was thrown on the ice each arm representing each of the wins it used to take to win the stanley cup 
*New York Rangers – also founded in 1926, “the Broadway Blueshirts.”

These six clubs built the foundation of the modern NHL. They were the only teams for a whole generation of fans, which is why you still hear so much about them today—even with 32 teams in the league now.

now with history out of the way on to today in the nhl the preseason has started 

Each of the 32 NHL teams will play 82 regular-season games in 2025-26. 
That works out to a total of 1,312 regular-season games across the league.

Kitty Top Ten List

Top 10 Unintentionally Hilarious Taylor Swift Moments That Broke the Internet (and Possibly Space-Time)

1. Taylor vs. The Chair (Eras Tour boss battle)
Imagine you're serving Vigilante Sht in thigh-high boots, about to do a sultry sit… and the chair disappears. Did she fall? Did she flinch? No. She just hovered like a broken Sims character and moved on like nothing happened. The chair filed for emotional damages.
---
2. “No, it’s Becky.” – The meme that refused to die
A Tumblr user posts a pic of Taylor saying it's “Becky who died from snorting marijuana once.” Internet: LOL. Taylor: Wears a “No, it’s Becky” shirt in public. The meme community ascended. Becky never recovered.
---
3. Taylor tries to walk backwards out of a gym like a cursed NPC
Paparazzi? She doesn’t know them. Taylor walked backwards out of a building, flanked by security, like someone trying to uninstall themselves from a glitchy mission in Grand Theft Auto. It’s still unclear if this was escape or performance art.
---
4. “Not to be dramatic but I would die for that squirrel”
She said this ONCE. Just ONCE. And the internet adopted it like it was Shakespeare. If you’ve never dramatically whispered this while watching wildlife, are you even doing life right?
---
5. Drunk Taylor at the 2019 VMAs: A spiritual experience
Champagne Taylor was front row, vibing so hard it looked like she was at a Lizzo-themed sleepover. The pointing. The swaying. The unfiltered joy. She was the afterparty. MTV has never been that fun since.
---
6. The cat filter Zoom call that never happened (but should’ve)
Okay yes, this one’s technically fan fiction — but someone edited Taylor into the viral “I’m not a cat” Zoom clip and everyone believed it was real for a second. Probably because if anyone would accidentally turn into a cat mid-meeting and roll with it, it’s her.
---
7. "Bleachella" 2016: the birth of chaotic neutral Taylor
Bleached hair. Dark lipstick. Random dance battles. Potentially summoning Tom Hiddleston. She showed up to the Met Gala looking like a Final Fantasy villain and left with a whole subplot that made Tumblr implode.
---
8. Taylor in Cats: a serious actress who also meows
She trained for this. She studied the feline arts. She purred. She crawled. She wore fur and heels. The movie tanked but Taylor’s milk-licking scene lives rent-free in our brains like a cursed TikTok.
---
9. Diet Coke + Cats = Chaos
She takes one sip of Diet Coke and kaboom — a glitter explosion of kittens. This ad was not supposed to be hilarious, but it ended up looking like someone accidentally leaned on the “spawn kitten” button too long. 10/10.
---
10. When she carried a framed photo of her Kanye moment to the VMAs
Taylor, in full sparkly gown, handed Kanye a Vanguard Award... while holding a photo of him interrupting her in 2009. No words. Just pettiness in picture form. Art. Iconic. Petty levels: platinum.
