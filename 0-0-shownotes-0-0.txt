National Forgiveness Day

Tomorrow is Global Forgiveness Day. And yeah, I know, that probably makes some people roll their eyes. These kinds of days can feel a little cheesy. But this one’s actually worth sitting with for a minute.

 Forgiveness doesn’t mean pretending you’re not hurt. It doesn’t mean forgetting, or letting people off the hook. It doesn’t mean you have to reach out to someone who betrayed you, or make peace with someone who still doesn’t take responsibility.

What it can mean, though, is giving yourself permission to stop carrying something that's been weighing on you for way too long.

Forgiveness isn’t really about the other person. It’s about you. It’s about taking your power back. It’s about making space in your head and your heart for something better. When we hold onto pain or anger, sometimes it feels like we’re protecting ourselves. And maybe we are, for a while. But if we’re not careful, that protection turns into a cage. At some point, it stops serving us and just starts keeping us stuck.

That doesn’t mean you force it. Forgiveness isn’t something you rush. Sometimes it takes time. Sometimes it takes boundaries. Sometimes it takes a whole lot of distance. And sometimes, it looks like letting go of the hope that the person who hurt you is ever going to make it right.

And then there’s the kind of forgiveness no one really talks about, which is the kind we need to give ourselves. That might be the hardest one. We beat ourselves up for trusting the wrong person, for missing the red flags, for staying too long, or for saying something we wish we could take back. But guilt doesn’t fix anything. It just builds shame, and shame keeps us quiet. Forgiving yourself doesn’t mean you don’t care—it means you finally do. It means you’re ready to stop punishing yourself and start healing instead.

Forgiveness is strength. It’s not weakness. It’s not rolling over or letting someone win. It’s you saying, I’m tired of carrying this around. I want my peace back. I want to move forward. I want better.

So maybe tonight, the night before Global Forgiveness Day, is a good time to check in with yourself. Is there something you’re holding onto that’s been taking up too much space in your life? Someone you haven’t been able to let go of, even if they’re no longer around? Are you still blaming yourself for something you’d never hold against someone else?

You don’t have to have it all figured out. You don’t have to forgive everyone and everything in one night. But maybe this is your reminder that you’re allowed to start. You’re allowed to say, I want something different for myself. You’re allowed to want peace.

Whatever it is, wherever you are in the process, you’re not alone. Most of us are still trying to untangle from old pain, and trying not to bring it into our future. That’s the real work. That’s the kind of forgiveness that matters.

And maybe that’s what tomorrow is really about. Not perfect closure, not instant healing, but just the willingness to loosen your grip on something that’s been hurting for too long, and to believe that there’s a better way forward.

To follow that, I want to share a song that kind of captures what it feels like to wrestle with all this stuff. It’s messy, it’s honest, and it reminds you that even when things feel dark and chaotic, it’s okay to not be okay. And more importantly, it’s okay to keep going.

This is “It’s Alright” by Mother Mother.

Weird Stuff Made By Same Company

You ever take a closer look at who actually makes the products in your life?
 Not just the logo on the box  I’m talking about the real company behind it. The parent company. The corporate empire quietly running ten different industries at once.
And I’m not talking about a candy company making both Skittles and M&M’s.
 I’m talking about a company that builds musical instruments... and also fighter jets.
 A car company that also makes sausages.
 A pen company that also helps you burn things.
Welcome to the strange world of corporate chaos. Here are some of the weirdest combinations you never knew were real:

Hitachi
You might know Hitachi for TVs or power tools. But behind the scenes, they build railway systems, excavators, and even military vehicles.
Fun fact: Despite what some rumors might suggest, Hitachi does not have a division for sex toys  although judging by their product range, it wouldn’t be that surprising if they did.

Volkswagen
Yes, the German car company. But in 1973, they also invented the Volkswagen currywurst  a branded sausage served to employees and sold in supermarkets and football stadiums.
 It even has an official part number: 199 398 500 A.
 The matching ketchup? 199 398 500 B.
 That’s right  a hot dog condiment is literally part of Volkswagen’s official inventory.

Yamaha
They’re the world’s largest musical instrument manufacturer  pianos, drums, guitars, horns.
 But they also make motorcycles, dirt bikes, ATVs, and snowmobiles.
 So you can play a concert... and then jump over it on a quad.

Kawasaki
You think motorcycles. But they’ve been around since 1878, and they’re a major military contractor for Japan.
 They build submarines, warships, and aircraft  second only to Mitsubishi when it comes to Japan’s defense industry.
 They literally went from Jet Skis to fighter jets.

Subaru
Famous for rally cars like the WRX STI.
 But their aerospace division works with the Japanese Defense Agency. They help maintain V-22 Ospreys, build target drones, and manufacture parts for Boeing aircraft  737s, 747s, 787s, and more.
 Oh, and until 2003? They also made buses and railway cars.
 So yeah  Subaru really did go from mountain roads to the skies.

General Electric (GE)
The company behind your light bulbs, your toaster, maybe even your fridge.
 But they also built the GAU-8 Avenger  the 30mm seven-barrel rotary cannon on the A-10 Warthog.
 That’s the gun that goes BRRRRT  the sound of God clearing his throat before erasing a tank.

Samsung
You know them for smartphones, TVs, and appliances.
 But Samsung also builds ships, oil tankers, and military hardware.
 They even run a theme park, a life insurance company, and their own construction division.
 Samsung is less of a tech company and more of a mini government.

Peugeot
Now a car company. But originally? They made coffee grinders, pepper mills, and saw blades.
 Their first products were kitchen tools and bicycles in the 1800s.
 So in a way, Peugeot was grinding beans before they were burning rubber.

IKEA
Yes meatballs and furniture. But also: emergency housing for refugees, solar panels, and flat-pack homes for disaster relief.
 Some IKEA houses can be assembled in under 4 hours.

Sony
You know Sony for the PlayStation. But they also own music labels, film studios, insurance companies, and even a bank in Japan.
 So while you’re button-mashing through God of War, Sony is out here producing movies, managing mortgages, and dropping albums.

Nestlé
They make chocolate, sure. But Nestlé owns over 2,000 brands  everything from baby formula to dog food, bottled water, frozen pizza, and medical nutrition supplements.
 Nestlé’s in your pantry, your fridge, your dog’s bowl, and your hospital room.
 That’s not a company  that’s a whole food chain.

Bic
Pens. Lighters. Razors.
 Basically, if you ever needed to write a breakup letter, light it on fire, and shave your head out of emotional distress  Bic has you covered.

DuPont
Started as a gunpowder company. Later invented Teflon, Kevlar, nylon, and half the science lab in Breaking Bad.
 They can start wars, end wars, cook your eggs, and keep you bulletproof while doing it.

Mattel
Barbie and Hot Wheels  kid stuff, right?
 But in the 1980s, Mattel also made home computers, video game consoles, and ran an entire electronics division.
 At one point, Barbie was closer to Bill Gates than Ken.

The Takeaway?
The brand on the box might be comforting. Familiar. But behind the curtain?
 That musical keyboard company might also be arming a fighter jet.
 Your sausage might have a car part number.
The world of big business is weird.
 And sometimes? It's not that far from light bulbs to war machines
