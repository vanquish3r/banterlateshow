INTRO TO OPENING ACT - VIDEOS PLAY AFTER

Hey everyone, thanks for being here tonight.

We're starting things off a little differently. Before we get into the usual fun, I want to take a moment to honour someone who meant a lot to a lot of people.

Ozzy Osbourne has passed away. For some, he was the godfather of heavy metal. For others, he was that wild voice screaming from their speakers when nothing else made sense. And for a lot of us, he was just Ozzy. Raw, real, and somehow still standing through it all.

He wasn’t perfect, and he never pretended to be. That was part of the magic. He gave everything to his music, to his fans, and to the world he helped shape. Whether it was Black Sabbath or his solo work, Ozzy left a mark that’s not going anywhere.

So tonight, we’re going to kick things off with some videos and a chance to remember a legend the way he’d probably want us to - loud and a little weird.

Rest easy, Ozzy. And thank you.

========================================================

DEADPOOL OZZY TRIBUTE 

Opening Speech
Hey everyone. First off, thanks for being here tonight—whether you came for the music, the stories, the tribute, or just to be in good company, I’m glad you’re here.

We’re here to talk about something that connects every single one of us, no matter where we come from—music. Whether it’s a heavy guitar riff, a line in a song that hits too close to home, or just a melody that gets us through the day—music stays with us. It lifts us up, holds us when we’re down, and sometimes… it screams when we can’t.

Tonight’s also about paying respect. A legend just left this world—Ozzy Osbourne, the Prince of Darkness himself. And whether you were blasting ‘Crazy Train’ as a teen, headbanging to Sabbath, or tearing up to ‘Mama I’m Coming Home,’ you felt what he brought to the table. He was wild, chaotic, misunderstood—but he was real. And when Ozzy stepped on stage, it wasn’t just a concert—it was a damn exorcism.
Transition into Discussion
So I want to open up this conversation—because music doesn’t just entertain us, it shapes us. It gives us identity, memory, comfort. I’ll ask some questions, but feel free to share what comes to mind. There’s no right or wrong here—just what’s real to you.
Discussion Prompts
• What’s one song that saved you during a rough time?
• Ever hear a song and get transported back to a certain moment in life?
• What artists do you turn to when you need to feel something real?
Ozzy Tribute Points
And thinking about Ozzy… man, that guy lived a hundred lives in one. He wasn’t afraid to be loud, dark, or emotional. That’s what made him legendary. He gave people permission to be who they are—even if it’s messy, misunderstood, or haunted by demons.

I know for me personally, songs like ‘Changes’ and ‘No More Tears’ hit different as I’ve grown older. He showed that even the darkest voices can carry light. And that’s what I want to take with me… that we don’t have to be perfect, we just have to be real.
Closing Thoughts
So tonight, let’s laugh, reminisce, maybe even cry a little. Let’s talk about the music that made us—and raise a glass to the ones who gave us a voice when we couldn’t find our own.

Here’s to Ozzy. Here’s to music. And here’s to all of us—still writing our own songs, one verse at a time.

BANT-LIB

	
It was just another glitchy [time of day] in Banter when DutchJones spawned in wearing a [adjective] cape made entirely of [plural noun].

"I've summoned this council for a reason," DutchJones declared dramatically, standing on top of a rotating pizza. "We have a problem in Banter. Someone [past tense verb] all the gravity settings."

Luna facepalmed. "Not again. Last time, Staticthreat floated into the sky yelling, ‘THIS IS FINE!’ for like 20 minutes."

Ron_B strolled in late, holding a suspicious-looking smoothie. "Did anyone try rebooting reality?"

Zephii, who was wearing a full-body suit of banana armor, sighed. "Honestly, I blame Deadpool. Every time something breaks, he's nearby doing that weird dance."

Deadpool responded by T-posing on a hoverboard and shouting, “I REGRET NOTHING.”

"Enough!" shouted Alleen, pulling out a glowing [object] from their inventory. “If we don’t recalibrate the servers with the sacred [noun], the skybox will collapse into a loop of screaming goats.”

Kilo rolled their eyes. "Why is it always goats?"

Oozyrat cracked their knuckles. "Let’s just teleport to the Chaos Temple and fight the boss. I’ve got my [weapon], and I’m not afraid to [verb]."

"Then it's settled," said DutchJones. "Squad, assemble! We ride at [funny number] o’clock."

Suddenly, the lights in the world flickered. A low [type of sound] echoed through the void.

Oozyrat pulled out a clipboard. "Okay. I’ve run the numbers. If we all dance in sync for exactly 42 seconds, we can reset the  physics engine."

Deadpool immediately started [dance move]. "Say less."

Alleen groaned. "This is how we all got stuck in the [part of a building] last time."

“Worth it,” Zephii muttered.

DutchJones raised their arms dramatically. "To the sync circle! For Banter, for glory, and for that sweet [type of music]!"

And so, they dance — awkwardly, gloriously, and entirely offbeat — as the fate of the virtual world hung in the balance.
