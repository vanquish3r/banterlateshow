"Love Wins": A Living Legacy of Pride, Protest, and Power

Tonight, we’re taking time to reflect on a phrase that has become more than just a slogan. It’s a declaration, a promise, and a reminder of how far we've come and how far we still have to go: “Love Wins.”

You’ve seen it on protest signs, in social media hashtags, in murals and t-shirts and tattoos. Two simple words that carry decades of struggle, celebration, heartbreak, and hope for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.

Most people associate the phrase with June 26th, 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was legal nationwide. That moment was electric. Across the country and around the world queer people and allies poured into the streets to celebrate. #LoveWins flooded timelines and newsfeeds, not just as a celebration of marriage equality, but as a public reclaiming of dignity and identity.

But the spirit behind “Love Wins” didn’t start in 2015.

It was there in the Stonewall uprising of 1969, when LGBTQ+ folks - especially Black and brown trans women and drag queens - stood up to police brutality and said “enough.”
It was there in the AIDS crisis of the '80s and '90s, when grieving lovers and friends refused to let their communities be erased in silence and founded activist groups like ACT UP, who fought for treatment, recognition, and humanity.
It’s in the Pride parades that turn grief and rage into joy and resilience. It’s in the quiet bravery of coming out in an unsafe home, or holding hands in public, or simply existing unapologetically.

And now, it’s a phrase we have to say not just with pride, but with resistance.

Because let’s be honest. “Love Wins” is being tested again.
Across the United States and beyond, we’re seeing a disturbing rise in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and rhetoric. Trans rights are being rolled back. Books are being banned. Healthcare is being denied. Politicians are trying to erase queer and trans people from classrooms, from history, and from the public sphere.

They want them to go back into hiding. To be quiet. To settle for less.

But here’s the truth: they won’t.

They won’t go quietly.
They won’t back down.
They won’t stop loving, living, marching, and shouting until every person - no matter who they are or who they love - can exist with safety, with joy, and with pride.And we will be there with them.

Because “Love Wins” isn’t just about marriage or milestones. It’s about the right to be.
The right to define your own identity.
The right to live free from fear.
The right to build families however they look and have them honored.

It's also a call to action. For allies to speak up, to show up, to vote, to protest, and to protect. Because this fight doesn't just belong to the queer community. It belongs to all of us who believe in freedom, in equality, and in the power of love to change the world.

So tonight, we say it louder.
We say it with pride.
We say it with defiance.

Love Wins.
Not just once. Not just in court.
But every time we choose authenticity over fear.
Every time we refuse to be erased.
Every time we remind each other that this fight is far from over—and that we’re in it together.

Because love doesn’t hide.
Love doesn’t lose.
Love wins. Always.
