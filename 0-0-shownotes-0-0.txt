JHAS Interview

Introduction of Jillian Holly. 
Jillian is an Author, musician, singer, songwriter, Intuitive Healer for 30 yrs and Manifestation Coach.  She created and facilitates the Kinetic Divination healing modality, and TV host on new reality TV.

Me: So, JHAS. I’d like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule cause I know that you are always busy to be here with us tonight and to talk about exactly what it is that you do and if I can tag off of that, what is kinetic divination?

Guest. explains:

Me:  And you have been a healer for 30 yrs.  Wow!! The word Divination, that might scare or throw some people off. When I looked it up, through google AI, it said, the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or hidden truths through supernatural or occult means. (Occult, In essence, the meaning of "occult" varies greatly between these two individuals due to their distinct belief systems and approaches to the unseen world.)

Divination, in its true sense, is the act of perceiving or discovering something with spiritual insight rather than ordinary means.

Me:  Now, I know that you have helped me in the past, and I was wondering, do you think you could demonstrate using a problem that I have right now to the audience so they can kind of see exactly what it actually looks like and sounds like?

Guest will work on me.

Then take any questions from the audience. 

Me: Again, I really thank you for coming tonight to the Banter Late Show & shedding some light on something that’s out there and some tools that we can use ourselves to help us in certain situations. And I hope you’ll do an event here in Banter at the time weaving Tower sometime soon.

Goodbye Colbert

Kitty - Yes if you haven’t heard folks, CBS informed Stephan Colbert Wednesday night that as of May 2026 the late show that has been running for over 32 years is going to go “poof”.  He informed his audience at the beginning of the show Thursday.

Video of Colbert announcing this plays

In a statement obtained by Reuters, Paramount executives wrote: "This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount."

Guess it didn’t help that on Monday, Stephan Colbert got back from vacation and said this on the show

“ he stated that “ as a proud employee of this network, I’m offended, I don’t think anything could repair my trust in this company.  But taking a stab at it, $16 million would help.”

Paramount, which owns CBS, is currently seeking a merger with Skydance Media, and the company agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris with CBS news program 60 Minutes, in which he said, the guy who sits in the White House, said, 60 minutes deceptively edited an interview with vice president Kamala Harris when they we’re running for president”. 

As Stephen Colbert puts  it, “it was a nuisance lawsuit that CBS had claimed was without merit.  And keep in mind that Paramount produced the transformers, the rise of the beast. So they know completely without merits.”

This was an airtight case that if it went to court, CBS  would have won.  It was an airtight case.  But, they didn’t want to jeopardize the merger.

We all know that late night shows usually roast political people and mostly conservatives because the conservatives honestly let’s just face it.  And late night TV host usually don’t bring on Republicans, because especially lately, they can’t seem to tell the truth. They tell the cameras one thing that they’re against something and then do something completely different so why would they have Republicans or conservatives on? They’re off the rails.

The reason many people believe that this was more than just financial reasons is because of the facts. 

Fact one. :  you have major corporations with more money than we could ever see controlling what you watch and what you hear.

Fact 2:  The CEO of Skydance, David Ellison Said he wants unbiased American storytelling. Well, we all know where that is going with all the book banning. and David Ellison’s father is Larry Ellison, who is a major Trump supporter

Fact 3:  Trump said, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday morning. “His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! [Fox News late night host] Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”

What makes all this sad is we have billionaires throughout history who get what they want because of money. What makes this personal for me is that when a certain person was running for office again, there was a merger going on between a major corporation, who my husband worked for And Turner enterprises that runs CNN. And Trump was not going to steal the merger unless CNN was taken off the air. So the corporation that my husband worked for was sued and a year later, my husband lost his job because they said that it was for financial reasons that they were making cutbacks. My husband had worked for 30 years for this company, is in a very specific and specialized field that you cannot just go and find a job unless you want to pick up where you live and move somewhere else in the country when you’re risking it again and he is over the age of 52 at the time that him and 150 other employees over the age of 52 with over 25 to 30 years with the company was let go. Still to this day we are struggling financially. And when I’m saying struggling, we made last year less money than my parents do on Social Security.  And my husband had lost our life long medical insurance that was part of retirement.

Kitty: Mentions something about videos, play two videos back to back
