A Slippery Slope 

(1960's, Norfolk, UK) The small seaside town at the mouth of the river Yare keeps a modern lifeboat at anchor in the harbour, but the old lifeboat shed is nearby. Its cobbled slipway descended at a 30-degree angle straight into the river. Four hundred yards away, the harbour opens into the North Sea. The next stop is the coast of Holland.

I was eight years old, and not afflicted by the degree of supervision that kids endure nowadays. That summer, a bunch of us decided it would be a great wheeze to take a discarded tractor tyre from the dump, and take turns curling up inside it while the others rolled us down the slipway into the river. The name of the game was to struggle out before the tyre reached the water.

This provided several minutes of hysterical fun, until the inevitable happened. All hell broke loose as the lucky winner and the tyre rapidly made their way to open sea. The sight of the big yellow Coast Guard helicopter and its crew saving his ass went some way towards compensating for the pain inflicted upon mine by my dad that evening.

Kitty's Top Ten
Top 10 Things That Instantly Tell You a Person Is About to Ruin Your Day
(Now with 40% more emotional scarring and passive aggression)

10. They start a sentence with “Not to be rude, but…”
Then proceed to be so rude your ancestors flinch.
---
9. They say, “Let me play devil’s advocate,” and then defend tax fraud, NFTs, and their cousin Greg who definitely did it.

8. They mention their podcast three times before you even learn their name.
Spoiler: It’s called "Unfiltered Alpha Energy." No one asked.

7. They claim “I’m just brutally honest,”
Then give unsolicited feedback on your face, life choices, and aura.

6. They whisper “Trust me” before touching exposed wires, your steering wheel, or your feelings.
---
5. They send you a calendar invite for a “quick 15-minute sync” that lasts long enough for your coffee to go cold and your will to live to evaporate.

4. They clap when the plane lands and stand up before the seatbelt sign goes off.
Bonus points if they hit you with their backpack on the way out.

3. They say “It’s giving…”
But what it’s giving is the energy of someone who microwaves fish at work.

2. They casually say “I’m a Pisces, so you have to forgive me”
Immediately after keying your car and stealing your emotional support water bottle.

1. They say “Let that sink in,”
Then physically bring out a porcelain sink and stare at you like you’re the weird one.

VR Horoscopes
Aries (Mar 21 – Apr 19)
You're charging into every new world like a toddler with jet boots. Slow down. Maybe read the controls before body-slamming someone in a karaoke lobby.
---
Taurus (Apr 20 – May 20)
You spent 90 minutes decorating your virtual apartment... then your roommate teleported in and rearranged everything. Rage level: maximum. Stars: indifferent.
---
Gemini (May 21 – Jun 20)
You’ve joined 12 worlds, made 8 friends, started 3 drama cycles — and you’ve been online for 45 minutes. The stars say: maybe sit down and pick a personality for the day.
---
Cancer (Jun 21 – Jul 22)
You formed a deep emotional bond with someone wearing a banana avatar. That’s not love. That’s attachment trauma in HD.
---
Leo (Jul 23 – Aug 22)
Yes, your avatar looks amazing. Yes, you made an entrance. No, nobody asked for your 27-minute monologue about your “creative process.” This is VR, not your memoir.
---
Virgo (Aug 23 – Sep 22)
You spent 20 minutes cleaning your VR inventory, alphabetizing potions, and labeling your weapons. Congratulations — nothing actually improved.
---
Libra (Sep 23 – Oct 22)
You’re still in the spawn zone debating which world to go to. It’s been two hours. You’ve had three existential crises. No one cares. Pick a damn portal.
---
Scorpio (Oct 23 – Nov 21)
You walked into a horror world just to watch everyone else scream. You are the villain. And yes, the stars fear you. As they should.
---
Sagittarius (Nov 22 – Dec 21)
You tried speedrunning a dungeon, accidentally married a goat NPC, and now the guild leader is demanding a duel. Meanwhile, your loot chest is full of expired tacos. Stars say: this is your life now, enjoy it.
---
Capricorn (Dec 22 – Jan 19)
You opened a spreadsheet... in VR. You’ve been taking meeting notes in a tavern. You are everything that’s wrong with productivity culture. Take a vacation. Touch some virtual grass.
---
Aquarius (Jan 20 – Feb 18)
You’re building a philosophical debate room where every chair floats and nothing has a floor. Everyone’s confused. You’re proud. We get it — you’re deep.
---
Pisces (Feb 19 – Mar 20)
You fell in love in a VR hot tub, wrote them a poem in the world chat, and then they turned into a corgi and flew away. Now you're staring at the virtual sky whispering, "Was any of it real?" Spoiler: it wasn’t. But your pain is beautiful.
