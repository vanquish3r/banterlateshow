Thank You Notes

kitty - Thank you, random background noise, for reminding us that someone’s always eating chips with their mic in their throat.

kitty - Thank you, Banter emojis, for giving me new ways to express emotions I didn’t know I had... like "wave at someone while internally screaming."

kitty - Thank you, weird echo, for letting me hear how annoying I sound in surround sound.

kitty - Thank you, default avatars, for giving off strong "I just woke up in the metaverse and don't know where I am" energy.

kitty - Thank you, teleporting friends, for popping in like horror movie jump scares. Love that.

kitty - Thank you, people who join events and just stare silently from a corner. Glad you could come.

kitty - Thank you, that one person who breathes directly into their mic. I didn’t need ASMR, but thanks for the lung content.

kitty - Thank you, avatar customization, for letting me create a version of myself I could never live up to.

kitty - Thank you, people who join events mid-discussion and shout “WHAT’S GOING ON,” for assuming we’re all your personal tour guides.

kitty - Thank you, Banter Late Show audience, for pretending this monologue isn’t just me talking to myself in a headset.

Weird TikTok Facts

kitty - Lobsters taste with their legs and chew with their stomachs.
TikTok ocean nerds delivered this crustacean chaos straight to your FYP.

kitty - Octopus brains are spread throughout their bodies.
Each arm has its own mini-brain, which lets them act semi-independently. Basically, they’re 8-brained geniuses.

kitty - You’ve been eating Tic Tacs wrong.
The cap of a Tic Tac container is actually designed to dispense one Tic Tac at a time.

kitty - Wombat poop is cube-shaped.
Yes, their poop comes out in little cubes. Scientists think it helps it stay in place when marking territory.

kitty - Your tongue rests on the roof of your mouth — or it should.
Tongue posture (aka "mewing") is a big TikTok thing — some claim it even changes your face shape over time.(Spoiler alert - it doens't)

kitty - The iPhone calculator deletes numbers if you swipe left or right.
People were today-years-old when they found that out on TikTok.
