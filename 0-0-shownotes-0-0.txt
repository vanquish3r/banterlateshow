Summer Solstice

In the northern hemisphere, it is the longest day of the year because the sun is at the highest point in the sky

Ancient druid would watch the sunrise at Stonehedge, which they still do to this day and have festivals
Vikings would have a big feast with singing and family

In Chinese tradition, the female energy yin is stronger than the masculine energy of Yang. They celebrate by wearing bright red colors, have dragon boat races, and they believe that it’s symbolize transformation and healing.

In Iceland, they would stay up all night and it was called the secret solstice. They would take swims in geothermal pools and have music and dance, which is still done today.

In the pagan religion, it’s also known as LITHA  they believed that that is when the veil was thinness between this world and the ferry realm and it was always a good idea to leave out milk and honey for the fairies and you don’t ever say thank you to a fairy because they don’t like that. Certain herbs are usually picked like St. John’s wart, and they believe that the oak tree would bring protection and blessings. You also would be using stones like crystals, sandstone moonstone citrine all except moonstones are sun stones, but the moonstone would actually give more energy to the sun stones. And the oak tree was very, very much a part of the celebration with it being a focal point. 

In Sweden it’s just one great big party. They have a Maypole dance and herb collecting songs, chanting and it is not like you would see in Midsommar.

Does anybody do anything special on summer solstice or now that you know about some of the things of summer solstice? Are you going to do anything special?

Many of us here today have have the pleasure of having dogs or cats. Some people just have cats and some people just have dogs so we’re gonna break it down on what we’ve come across that make dog people dog people and cat people cat people. I personally don’t agree with this whole list but there’s some of you that might be able to relate.

=========================================================

Superstitions

Open an umbrella indoors

Breaking a mirror bad luck for seven years 

A black cat crossing your path

Spilling salt

Knocking on wood when you think something might go wrong

Friday the 13th

In Italy, Friday the 17th is actually they’re unlucky day

In Viking culture there was a story about 12 Warriors having dinner and then Loki came in and absolutely caused chaos so that’s why they believe in the 13th or the 13th isn’t unlucky number

Anybody here have any superstitions and what are they?

No Kings

June 14th was the No Kings Nationwide Day of Defiance — a powerful and emotional day where people across the United States rose up together to say: We will not be ruled. While I speak, the video playing behind me is showing real images from those protests. Faces in the streets. Signs held high. People marching with purpose, courage, and so much heart. These aren't just clips. They're proof of a movement that refuses to be ignored.

“No Kings” isn’t just a catchy phrase or a one-day hashtag. It’s a message. It’s a warning to those in power, and a rallying cry for everyone who still believes in democracy, truth, and freedom. It means rejecting the rise of authoritarianism. It means standing against anyone who tries to put themselves above the people — including Donald Trump, who has made it clear that he wants control, not leadership. This movement is about stopping that before it's too late.

Lately, I’ve been watching what’s happening across the United States with these protests, and I’ve got to say, it’s been both heartbreaking and inspiring. Heartbreaking because of what people are being forced to fight against, but inspiring because so many are standing up anyway. They’re refusing to stay silent, and they’re making it clear that they will not allow a wannabe dictator to take control without a fight.

This isn’t just another news headline. This is a turning point. People across the U.S. are raising their voices, gathering in the streets, and making it known that they won’t be ruled by fear, by lies, or by someone who sees power as a crown to be worn instead of a responsibility to the people. These protests are about protecting democracy. They’re about protecting the right to choose, to speak, to live without being controlled by someone who would rather silence the people than serve them.

As a Canadian watching this unfold, I feel an overwhelming sense of respect for every single person who’s out there protesting, organizing, educating, and resisting. It would be so easy to stay home, to scroll past it all, to say, “Well, what can I even do?” But they’re not doing that. They’re showing up. And it matters. It matters more than ever.

We need to talk about how important it is to protest — peacefully, powerfully, and with purpose. Protest isn’t about causing chaos. It’s about refusing to let things slide when they’re wrong. It’s about saying, “We see what you’re doing, and we’re not going to pretend it’s okay.” The people protesting right now are putting their time, energy, and safety on the line to protect not just their own rights, but the rights of everyone else too. That’s courage. That’s community.

And this isn't just an American issue. When democracy is under attack anywhere, it sends ripples outward. What happens in the U.S. affects the rest of the world, especially those of us here in Canada who share a border, values, and deep connections. So when we see a former president trying to climb back into power by undermining the very system that held him accountable, we need to pay attention. We need to be loud in our support for those pushing back.

Let’s be honest: this isn’t about left or right anymore. This is about truth and lies. Freedom and control. Democracy and dictatorship. And it’s not just one man trying to take power. It’s the people around him, the ones enabling it, normalizing it, hoping people are too tired or too distracted to fight back. That’s why what’s happening right now is so important. It’s not just a protest. It’s a resistance to something dangerous and real.

Silence doesn’t keep us safe. Sitting out doesn’t protect anyone. When people say, “I don’t do politics,” what they’re really saying is, “I’m okay with whatever happens next, even if it hurts someone else.” That’s not good enough. Not now.

The people in the streets, holding signs that say “No King,” aren’t just protesting for themselves. They’re protesting for all the people who don’t have the luxury of waiting it out. For immigrants. For LGBTQ+ folks. For Black and Brown communities. For women. For workers. For the people who are always the first to be hurt when someone starts stripping rights away.

They’re standing up for the idea that no one should be above the law, and no one should be able to grab power just because they want it. They’re reminding all of us that democracy only works if people care enough to defend it. And that’s what this moment is about — defending what’s right. Pushing back against lies. Making it clear that we will not let history repeat itself without a fight.

If you’re feeling powerless watching all this unfold, you’re not alone. But you’re not actually powerless. There’s strength in bearing witness. There’s strength in using your voice to amplify the truth. There’s strength in standing beside others, even from across a border, and saying, “We see you. We support you. Keep going.”

Because this fight isn’t just for one country. It’s for the soul of what’s fair, what’s just, and what’s possible when people don’t give up. And if there’s one thing I know, it’s that the people won’t back down. They’ve had enough. And they’re making sure the world knows it.

So to everyone marching, protesting, resisting in the U.S. right now: thank you. Thank you for not sitting quietly. Thank you for doing the hard thing. Thank you for showing the rest of us what courage looks like. You’re not alone. We’re with you.

And to the ones trying to take control while pretending it’s justice — history will not remember you kindly. You are not untouchable. You are not unstoppable. You are not above the people.

Because no matter how long it takes, power built on fear will always fall.
And the people will still be standing.

BANT-LIBS

It was a(n) [EMOTION] day on Banter when IrishDuchess spawned in wearing a hat made entirely out of [PLURAL NOUN]. They waved to everyone in the plaza, accidentally knocking over a [OBJECT] with their enthusiasm.

Across the room, Kilo was busy [VERB-ING] on top of a floating chair, mumbling something about [MYTHICAL CREATURE] conspiracies. Just then, a loud [SOUND EFFECT] echoed through the world, and the ground began to tremble.

Giggley let out a dramatic gasp, dropped their [SILLY ITEM], and yelled, “[NONSENSE PHRASE]!” which startled PandaChef so much they launched a tray of virtual [FOOD] into the air.

From the corner, DutchJones emerged slowly, dressed like a [PROFESSION] for reasons no one questioned. “It’s happening,” they said gravely, pointing at a glitching [NOUN] that was now hovering midair and chanting in binary.

Constantine rolled their eyes and calmly pulled out a [RIDICULOUS OBJECT]. “I knew this day would come,” they muttered, before being swept away by a sudden gust of [ELEMENTAL FORCE].

As chaos erupted, DivineSlayer rode in on a glowing, mechanical [ANIMAL], shouting something inspirational in slow motion. “We need backup!” cried Staticthreat, who had somehow gotten stuck inside a [PLACE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE STUCK IN].

Out of nowhere, Zaf appeared holding a sign that read “[MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE, BADLY PARAPHRASED]” and everyone just sort of nodded in agreement.

And that’s how Banter was saved... or maybe doomed. Hard to say, honestly.



So do you feel that you are a cat for a person or a dog person? 
Do you agree or disagree or what are your thoughts on what we have come up with?
