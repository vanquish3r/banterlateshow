National Irish Duchess Day

-> Ron_B:

  "As you know Kitty, that’s not the end of the national days announcements"

  "We have one more, special day to announce, but before we can do that, we need to get some business out of the way first"

  "During last week’s show, you made a bet with your co-host Irish Dutchess, that she wouldn’t be able to get through reading the Bant-lib without cracking up completely"

  "Of course, she got through the reading, like a champ, as the rest of us laughed our asses off"

  "As a result, you lost the bet"

  "For those of you who weren’t here last week, have no idea what we’re talking about, or just want to re-live that moment, you should totally go to youtube.com/@BanterLateShow, and watch episode 63"

  "So here we are, one week later, and it’s time to fulfill the promise of your bet"

-> discordkitty:

  "But, it wasn’t enough for us to just simply announce a new day. After all, it’s right in the title: 'official'"

  "So, here at the Banter Late Show, we did our homework. We needed someone official to agree to this new day, so it could become official. And who’s more official in Banter than Shane!"

  "Please welcome to the stage, our very own Shane!"

  (wait for Vanquish3r to bring out Shane avatar)

  "Thank you Shane for coming out on the stage early to do this. I know you usually just silently deliver the Sell It In a Minute item, but we're hoping you'll make an exception this week, by actually saying something on the show for the first time.  As you know, we need your agreement to be able to make today official. So, do you Shane, the most official person in Banter, agree to make today Official Irish Dutchess Day?"

  (wait for Vanquish3r to play Shane response audio clip)

  "Thank you Shane! We’ll see you again later in the show for Sell It In A Minute"

  (Vanquish3r has Shane avatar leave the stage)

-> Ron_B:

  "With that official agreement, it my honour and privilege, as this week’s co-host, to add to the national days, for the first time ever, a Banter exclusive: Today, June 22nd, 2025, is Official Irish Dutchess Day!"

Banter IRL
==========

-> discordkitty:

  "This is a new, hopefully semi-regular segment, where we dedicate some time to celebrate the amazing people of Banter who’s friendships have developed enough that they decided to meet up in real life"

  "Before we get to this week’s meet up though, there was another IRL meet up that happened between Irish Dutchess and Waffleman a few months ago that we wanted to acknowledge. Here's a video clip from that IRL meet up"

  (Play video clip of Irish Dutchess IRL dressed in Waffle head)

  "There could also be others that we’re not aware of, so we invite everyone who has found a friendship in Banter, which led to an IRL meet up, that they’d like to share and talk about, to please reach out to us so we can feature it on the show"

  "This week, since Ron is co-hosting, we thought we’d invite Zephii up onto the stage, so they could both talk about how they met IRL at the Toronto Congress Centre, for Anime North about a month ago, on May 24th"

Banter IRL Interview Questions
------------------------------

=> What motivated you to meet up IRL?

  -> Ron_B
    - Talk about how I mentioned that I was going to Anime North with my friend, visiting from the UK. Next thing I know is Zephii says he’s got a ticket for the same day, and wanted to meet up there. I was stoked!
  -> Zephii
    - Talk about how Vanq encouraged me to join Ron and his UK friend, since we’re both in the Greater Toronto Area. Even reminding him to get off of Banter, and go to sleep the night before 

=> I understand that there were some challenges getting to the venue. Tell us about them.

  -> Zephii
    - Talk about anxiety and struggles leaving his house
  -> Ron_B
    - Took the Go train and bus, but we got on the wrong bus. Should have been a hint when the bus before was so full we couldn’t get on, the next one with the same number, but different suffix, was almost empty, and hardly anyone else at the packed bus stop got on it

=> How did your first face-to-face encounter go?

  -> Ron_B
    - As you can see from the pics, I dressed like my avatar so Zephii could recognize me. The morning of, since we both had iPhones, we used the Find My app to share location, and we exchanged photos so we’d recognize each other. I’m not sure if Zephii noticed, but I greeted him IRL as I do in Banter, I exclaimed Zephii and jumped up in front of him
  -> Zephii
    - Talk about how the initial meeting went from my perspective. How Ron helped me get registered for a badge, since he had did it earlier 

=> What notable things happened while there?

  -> Ron_B
    - It was one adventure after another

  First coffee adventure:

  -> Ron_B
    - After registering, we were all ready for a coffee, and Zephii needed some breakfast. Ended up at Starbucks at the hotel across the street from the Convention Centre 
  -> Zephii
    - Brought Q3 and decided to test reactions to wearing it in public, while we waited in the long, long line for much needed coffee and shitty croissant with no butter. Wore it the entire time in the line, while ordering, and picking up my order. That’s a picture in my headset at Starbucks. No one cared that I was wearing it!

  Breakfast / food adventure:

  -> Zephi
    - Still needed something to eat, and there were long lines at every food place near the venue. Very poorly set up. Ended up at Burger King and got a combo
  -> Ron_B
    - My UK friend disappeared on us, to go get some anime merchandise

  Sword fighting adventure:

  -> Ron_B
    - As we came back to the venue, there were some mock sword fighting (practice / lessons) on the lawn
  -> Zephii
    - I wanted to try, but they said it wasn’t a good idea while under the influence of weed. Ended up sitting on the lawn outside, a bit further away to smoke the vapes I brought 

  Inside the Anime North Venue adventure:

  -> Zephii
    - Bought hat, bought nice pokemon card
  -> Ron_B
    - Helped to find a specific vendor to get a free gift that Zephii really wanted (was on the badge). Turned out to be 5% off stuff at their booth

=> How did you end the day?

  -> Zephii
    - In Banter, of course! Got into my headset again, after dinner, went to the minecraft world and talked with Vanq from Anime North. I even handed the headset to Ron and he also talked with Vanq
  -> Ron_B
    - Yep, and when we finally left the venue, and got home, we both met up in Cannabanter, of course, to talk with Vanq at length about the whole day

=> Would you do it again?

  -> Zephii
    - We’ve already planned to meet up again at Toronto Pride on Saturday, June 28th. We’ll be bringing you lots of pictures for next week’s show too
  -> Ron_B
    - Also, it’s kind of short notice, but if anyone else from Banter was already planning to be there, or wants to join us, you are more than welcome to. You can reach out on Discord to Zephii or myself to let us know so we can arrange a meeting place and time


You Can’t Do That On Television Sketch
======================================

-> Ron_B:

  "For some reason, co-hosting this show reminds me of that Canadian kids sketch TV show, from back in the day, called 'You Can’t Do That On Television'”

-> discordkitty:

  "Absolutely! I remember that show. It was on YTV. I think it had 10 full seasons, running from 1979 to 1990, and was even picked up by Nickelodeon in the US. We have a clip"

  (Vanquish3r plays clip from show)

-> Ron_B:

  "Oh, yeah. I remember that bad things would happen to the hosts when they said a certain word or phrase.  They’d be drenched in water if they said the word 'water'"

-> discordkity:

  "Yep, and they’d get green slime dumped on their heads if they said 'I don’t know'"

-> Ron_B:

  "That’s right. It’s a good thing we don’t have anything like that on this show"

-> discordkitty:

  "Absolutely. We’re too high brow of a show for that"

  (hold for chuckles, hopefully)

-> Ron_B:

  "Although, I thought there was one phrase we couldn’t say"

-> discordkitty:

  "Really? What’s that?"

-> Ron_B:

  "You know, it got carried over from the original LGBTQ+ Meetup that Chris used to run"

-> discordkitty:

  "I don’t recall"

-> Ron_B:

  "It was a PC game that he didn’t like, and we weren’t allowed to mention"

-> discordkitty:

  "Nope, not ringing any bells"

-> Ron_B:

  "Seriously? I can even hear people shouting it out in the audience"

-> discordkitty:

  "I can’t really hear what the audience is saying"

-> Ron_B:

  "It was the sequel to a multiplayer shooter by Blizzard, released in 2023?"

-> discordkitty:

  "Diablo IV? But that was an action role playing game"

-> Ron_B:

  "No, I’m talking about a multiplayer shooter!"

-> discordkitty:

  "Um, nothing is coming to mind"

-> Ron_B:

  "Come on! You’re supposed to say Overwatch 2!"

  (Ron gets kicked / lightening off the stage)

-> discordkitty:

  "Hahahaha.  That was too easy"
