Thank You Notes

“Thank you, VR headset… for giving me six pack abs—because every time I bend down to grab my controllers off the floor, it feels like a workout.”

Thank you, loading screens in VR, for being the only time I actually stop and reflect on my life while floating in an endless void.

“Thank you, Mute button.. For being on when I think you're off. I love talking for an hour then realizing no one can hear me.”

Thank you, random glitchy avatars, for turning serious meetings into accidental horror films.

“Thank you, VR cables… for keeping me humble by turning every game into an escape room where the puzzle is not choking myself.”

Thank you, 3AM VR sessions, for convincing me that spending six hours in a virtual bowling alley with strangers is a completely normal life choice.

“Thank you, hand tracking… for letting me feel like Iron Man… until you glitch and my hands turn into gang signs I definitely didn’t mean.”

Thank you, tiny virtual keyboards, for turning every message into a high-stakes finger ballet of typos and shame.

“Thank you, VR horror games… for making me scream louder than a dial-up modem. My neighbors think I’m being exorcised.”

Thank you, VR horror games, for giving me the experience of peeing myself in 4K.

“Thank you, virtual walls… for showing up after I’ve punched my real wall. Glad we’re on the same team.”

Thank you, invisible VR boundaries, for doing absolutely nothing while I punch a wall, a shelf, and possibly a family member.

“Thank you, VR microphone… for faithfully transmitting every single heavy breath I make so my friends know I’m out of shape.”

Thank you, avatar customization, for letting me express my true self… as a hot dog in a top hat.

“Thank you, Beat Saber… for tricking me into cardio while also making me look like a Jedi having a seizure.”

Thank you, headset fog, for giving me the immersive experience of what it's like to explore a fantasy world inside a bathroom mirror.

“Thank you, VR updates… for being larger than actual reality. Guess I’ll play again sometime next year.”

Thank you, social VR events, for reminding me that even in virtual reality… I can still be awkward at a party.

“Thank you, headset lenses… for being the only surface in my life that gets dirtier than my internet search history.”

Thank you, random strangers in VR, for walking up to me, staring silently for ten seconds, and then vanishing. You are the ghosts of the metaverse.

Today on Banter, [adjective] adventures were unfolding. DutchJones decided to [verb] right in the middle of the [room/area], causing DivineSlayer to spill their [drink/snack] everywhere.

Giggley was busy [verb ending in -ing] while yelling about a [plural noun], and Kate tried to calm everyone down with a [adjective] speech about [topic]. Staticthreat, however, was too busy [verb] at BigJon, who had just built a [noun] out of [material].

Meanwhile, Rabbit challenged Vanquish3r to a [adjective] race across the [virtual location], with RazorSmiles cheering so loudly that DraculusX accidentally [verb] into a [object].

IrishDutchess watched the chaos and sighed, muttering, “If only everyone could just [verb] like normal humans.” But of course, on Banter, nothing is ever [adjective].

And that, folks, is just another [adjective] day on Banter.
