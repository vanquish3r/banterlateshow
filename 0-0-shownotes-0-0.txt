Who Wants To Marry The Devil

🎭 GAME SHOW CONCEPT: “HELL YEAH! Who Wants to Marry the Devil?” 🔥💍

Welcome to the infernal lovefest where sinners shoot their shot at Satan in a spicy dating competition from the deepest pits of prime-time hell.

⸻

🔔 Show Premise:

A devilishly charismatic Lucifer is ready to settle down (for the next millennia, at least). He’s had it with doomed flings and is looking for a forever damnation. Each episode, contestants compete in sinful games, answer morally dubious questions, and show off their flair for the dramatic.

The prize? A flaming prenup, a wedding in the Ninth Circle, and a throne next to Satan himself.

⸻

🧑‍🎤 Contestants:
    •    A former televangelist turned goth influencer
    •    A tax fraud accountant with a thing for fire
    •    A chaotic-neutral witch from Florida
    •    An ex-Hell’s Kitchen contestant who got kicked off for seducing the host
    •    A demon cosplayer who doesn’t realize the show is real

⸻

🔥 SEGMENTS & ROUNDS

“Sin-derella Stories”

Each contestant tells their most “damnable” life moment. Bonus points if it’s petty, ironic, or poetic justice.

Lucifer’s take: “Mmm, delicious. Betrayed your best friend and evaded parking tickets? You spicy little soul-snatcher.”

⸻

“Would You Rather: Eternal Edition”

Hellish hypotheticals to test compatibility.

Sample questions:
    •    Would you rather spend eternity trapped in a DMV or at a baby gender reveal party that never ends?
    •    Would you rather be the ruler of a minor circle of Hell or Satan’s trophy spouse with unlimited spa privileges?
    •    Would you rather give up coffee… or humanity?

⸻

“Flame or Shame”

Contestants pitch how they’d spice up Hell. Think Shark Tank meets Inferno Renovation Showdown.
    •    “I’d install a lava Jacuzzi for Beelzebub’s lower back pain.”
    •    “Honestly? Hell could use a Whole Foods. Just for irony.”

Lucifer scores ideas with 🔥s or 👎🏼s.

⸻



“Speed Dating in the Underworld”

60 seconds per contestant. Lucifer throws curveball questions to see who keeps up.

Sample questions:
    •    “How would you punish a telemarketer in your circle of Hell?”
    •    “What’s your toxic trait—and why is it kinda hot?”
    •    “Do you see yourself more as a ‘baby sacrifice’ brunch date or a ‘conjuring ritual under the moonlight’ type?”

⸻

💍 FINALE:

Lucifer gives out the Ring of Fire to one contestant, and together they descend through a flaming trapdoor to their honeymoon in the Hotter Than Hell Suite.

Persona Questions: to make it easy for the persona questions if you want me to introduce that I can essentially will just be side-by-side me and my demon costume you and whatever for me wants even if you just wanna be kitty that would work too. They ask one question and we both give an answer.
