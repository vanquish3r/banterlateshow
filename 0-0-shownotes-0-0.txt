Darwin Award 

Alright, folks, let me tell you a story about a guy who really, truly deserves a Darwin Award… except he didn’t get it, because somehow he survived. And when I say survived, I mean against all odds. This is the story of the Dumpster Nap.

Picture this: Saskatchewan, Canada. It’s a quiet night. Somewhere in the suburbs, a 36-year-old man decides that instead of a bed, a couch, or literally any indoor sleeping arrangement, he’s going to take a nap in a dumpster. I know, I know… I don’t get it either. Maybe he thought it was adventurous. Maybe he thought it was cozy. Maybe he just hates furniture. Who knows.

So he climbs in, makes himself comfortable among the leftover pizza boxes, soggy bags, and who knows what else, and drifts off to sleep. Meanwhile, the universe is preparing its version of a practical joke. Hours later, the garbage truck arrives. And here’s where it gets insane. The dumpster is lifted, tipped, and emptied into the compactor. Basically, our guy goes from zero to human pancake in a matter of seconds.

Now, if you’re picturing instant death, you’re not alone. That’s what everyone thought. But somehow, by some miracle, this man survives. He’s found groaning, bruised, battered, ribs broken, jaw fractured, arm busted, and lying in a literal pile of trash. I mean, you have to admire the commitment. Most people wake up after a bad dream and just hit snooze. He wakes up flattened, surrounded by garbage, and thinks, “Yep. Still me.”

Firefighters and police rush in, and by all accounts, they are equal parts horrified and impressed. They pull him out, patch him up, and send him to the hospital. And somewhere, quietly, a dumpster is probably still judging him.

So what’s the moral of this story? Well, it’s simple. Dumpster naps are a terrible idea. Just because it’s dark, quiet, and kind of shaped like a bed doesn’t mean it’s safe. And if you ever find yourself thinking, “I could totally take a quick nap in the trash tonight,” remember this man. Remember that the universe has a sense of humor. And remember that sometimes surviving sheer stupidity is luckier than winning the lottery.

So tonight, when you’re cozy in your sleeping bag or on your couch or your actual bed, give a little nod to this guy and be glad you didn’t try a Dumpster Nap. And maybe, just maybe, sleepovers should stick to blankets and pillows, not refuse and human error.
