Community Spotlight

Tonight’s Community Spotlight is going to be a little different. Usually, this is where we highlight one person who’s made a difference, someone who brings light and energy to the spaces we share. But with everything we’ve been through together, it didn’t feel right to focus on just one name.

This time, the spotlight belongs to all of you.

Every single person who stayed, who supported one another, who helped us rebuild, who continued to show up even when things were messy or unclear... this moment is for you. I’ve seen this community hold together through a lot, and it reminded me why we started doing this in the first place.

So before we move forward with the rest of the show, I want to take a few minutes to speak directly to the people who have carried this with me and helped make it something worth holding onto.
---
Letter To The Community

I am speaking from the heart and I know I say that a lot, but I mean it every time. This has been a hard year. A weird year. A transformative year. And through all of it, this community has been the one thing that’s kept me steady.
---
We’ve weathered some storms together. We’ve had to make big decisions, take some risks, and hold space for each other through uncertainty, confusion, and a lot of emotional weight. None of that was easy. There were days where I questioned everything, and nights where I was just trying to hold it all together. But somehow, you kept showing up. And not just to events. You showed up for me. You showed up for each other.
---
We left a platform we had put so much time and heart into. We had to face things we didn’t want to face. We had to untangle truths from stories that were only partly true. We had to rebuild trust, not just in others, but sometimes in ourselves.
---
And still, here we are.

Still running events. Still laughing together. Still building worlds and ideas and spaces where people feel like they belong. Still holding each other up.

I want you to know that I see the effort. I see the late nights, the quiet support, the way you show up when someone needs a voice in the room. I see the creativity, the kindness, and the ridiculous sense of humour that makes this place feel like home. I see the way you’ve trusted me even when I didn’t always feel like I had the right answers.
---
I also want to acknowledge that I made some hard calls this year that had a big impact on people. I made those decisions based on what I believed to be true at the time. Some of that truth was real. Some of it was twisted. Some of it I had to learn the hard way. And I know that through all of it, many of you stayed by my side, even when things got complicated. For that, I am deeply grateful.
---
We are still here. We are still standing. And we are still building something real.

Encrypted is more than just an event group. It is a movement. It is a family. It is a place where people find their voice, their purpose, their weird, their spark. It is a place where healing happens, sometimes without anyone having to say a word. It is proof that when people come together with intention and heart, something powerful can grow from even the messiest of beginnings.
---
I do not take your time for granted. I do not take your trust for granted. And I do not take this community for granted. We have something rare here. Something that not every online space gets to have.

As we keep going forward, my hope is that we hold on to that. That we keep showing up. That we keep making space for each other. That we keep having fun, trying new things, taking creative risks, and building something that doesn’t just entertain people, but uplifts them.
---
So thank you. Thank you for believing in this. Thank you for believing in each other. Thank you for believing in me, even when I was struggling to believe in myself.

We are not done yet. Not even close.

I love you all. And I’m really glad you’re here.

Thank You Notes

Dutch - “Thank you… VRChat worlds… for letting me explore cyberpunk cities, fantasy kingdoms, and space stations. And somehow… I still spend most of my time in ‘Small Room With Couch.’”

kitty - Thank you VRChat for not needing me to constantly press X to straighten my legs ... even if I still do it reflectively
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat games… for teaching me teamwork, patience, and how to get betrayed by someone in a shark costume.”

K - Thank you VRChat for making every large group experience a cacophony of voices I can't follow and never keeping my volume settings persistent once I get them right. 
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat friends… for making every event fun. Even when the world crashes, the audio breaks, and somebody shows up as a literal banana.”

K - Thank you VRChat for making it so incredibly easy to avoid little children. Really, thank you. I mean that. Their shrill, slur-filled voices truly make my ovaries shrivel. Where the fuck are your parents? 
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat world portals… for letting me instantly travel anywhere I want. Unless it’s a private instance — then it’s just rejection with loading screens.”

K - Thank you VRChat for giving all of my "friends" a plethora of new ways to harass me both in and outside of the app.
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat movie nights… for proving that the only thing better than watching a movie… is watching a movie while your friend’s mic randomly blasts chewing noises at full volume.”

K - “Thank you… VRChat nameplates… for letting me read people’s usernames from across the room. Because nothing ruins immersion like trying to have a deep emotional moment with ‘butt-sniper-69.’”
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat audio settings… for giving me only two options: whisper quiet… or full-on airhorn.”

K - “Thank you… VRChat portals… for reminding me that every adventure starts with someone yelling: ‘Don’t go in yet!’ right as everyone already went in.”
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat desktop players… for standing completely still in the corner like NPCs waiting for a quest.”

K - “Thank you… VRChat murder mystery… for proving that nothing says ‘friendship’ like getting stabbed by the person you trusted most.”
---
D - “Thank you… karaoke in VR… for teaching us that the bravest thing you can do… is unmute.”

K - “Thank you… emote wheels… for giving me 30 different options… all of which I accidentally trigger at the wrong time.”
---
D - “Thank you… giant VRChat wings… for turning every group photo into Where’s Waldo: Feather Edition.”

K - “Thank you… Avatar Effects… for letting me enjoy a fireworks display so realistic, my frames dropped faster than the ball in Times Square.”
---
D - “Thank you… VRChat friends list… for showing me who’s online, who’s away, and who’s ‘definitely not hiding in a private instance.’”

K - “Thank you… VRChat group photos… for proving that no matter how many times we line up, someone will always face the wrong way.”

VR News Update

“Good evening, I’m Dutch Jones, and here’s tonight’s top story:

A round of the VRChat game Ghost last night collapsed into what experts are calling ‘the first match lost entirely to bad spending habits.’

The disaster began when Giggley showed up on horseback. Instead of collecting dollar bills, her horse ate them straight off the ground, leaving her broke and one unlucky teammate airborne after a well-timed kick.
---
Big Jon tried to ‘fix the economy’ by spawning his virtual sports car, declaring he’d drive faster between money drops. Instead, he ran over two allies and parked directly on top of a cash pile, turning the spawn point into a traffic accident.

Captn Dan—who looks suspiciously like the devil—blew every single bill he had on one shiny pistol. He missed his first shot, dropped the gun, and immediately got killed holding nothing but receipts. Panda, meanwhile, bounced around the map hoarding dollar bills like a caffeinated vacuum cleaner, only to spend them all on the weakest starter rifle.
---
Vanquish3r announced he was “digitizing his wallet” and accidentally uploaded his cash to the blockchain. Within minutes, Zed hacked it and spent the balance on “a premium gun,” which turned out to be a toy gun that shot beans instead of bullets.

Static, meanwhile, ignored the ghosts completely and spent all his bills at the snack machine. By the time the lobby realized he was stockpiling bacon instead of ammo, the only thing he had left to fight with was a greasy fingers.
---
The rest of the squad didn’t help much. Divine distracted half the lobby with one of her avatars, and Constantine spent the whole round dropping dollar bills just to tip people with compliments so sweet two players rage-quit for dental care.

Irish pirouetted through the battlefield shouting, “This is ballet, bitches!” while Berry stayed AFK—yet somehow ended the round richer than half the team.
---
Ghost Droid built a brand-new map mid-match, Zaf added an intro sequence so dramatic everyone thought the chaos was a Netflix trailer, and Pony reminded the group, “Guys, the tutorial literally says ‘pick up money, buy guns, shoot ghosts.’” Naturally, nobody listened.

Kilo—still recovering from COVID—showed up in an avatar so shiny it blinded his teammates. Half the squad got wiped out staring into the glow before the ghosts even pulled the trigger.
---
Just when it seemed hopeless, Kitty reached into her inventory and pulled out her cat, Zelda. Nobody knows how a cat got coded into the game, but Zelda leapt straight at the lead ghost, shredded its hitbox to pieces, and triggered a game-ending victory screen.

When the dust settled, Panda sighed: “Thanks for playing Ghost. Tune in next week—when the only mystery will be how a cat carried harder than the whole team.”
---
VR-Libs

It was a [adjective] evening in VRChat when PandaChef logged in wearing a [ridiculous object] on their head and immediately started [verb ending in -ing] a [plural noun]. IrishDuchess appeared out of nowhere riding a [mythical creature], shouting, “[silly phrase]!”

Arken tried to [verb] through a [adjective] portal, but BerryBerryNice accidentally [verb ending in -ed] into a [object], which exploded into [plural noun]. Constantine screamed and started [verb ending in -ing] with a [object] stuck on their [body part], while Divine tried to [verb] it all away using only a [random item].
---
Ded Zed challenged Khalima to a [adjective] dance-off on top of a [silly object], and the winner got a lifetime supply of [plural noun]. PandaChef, not to be outdone, began [verb ending in -ing] every [object] in sight, causing IrishDuchess to fall into a [location] filled with [plural noun].

In the end, everyone posed for a [adjective] screenshot, with Arken juggling [plural noun], BerryBerryNice riding a [adjective] [object], and Ded Zed mysteriously [verb ending in -ing] midair. Khalima sighed and muttered, “Only in VRChat could this be considered [adjective] fun.”

Product Reviews

This review is from: Wenger 16999 Swiss Army Knife Giant (Tools & Home Improvement)

Received this knife as a gift for my 18th birthday. Wish I'd have known what it was because as soon as I touched it, I grew a mustache and became a Navy Seal. Mom fainted and my dad laughed and handed me a beer. I was born a girl.
Minus 2 stars because my breasts were really nice
---
Review for The Mane Barber Shop 
Shout out to my man Henry who not only didn't mention the heinous fart I ripped in his chair, but casually aimed the blow dryer at my crotch for about 15 seconds while pretending to be distracted by the TV to save us both. True professional.

Haircut is also always on point if you care about that sort of thing.

2.This review is from: Star Wars: Battlefront - Deluxe Edition - PlayStation 4 (Video Game) Congratulations EA. You earned one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $5.49 each.

Review for tiny little plastic babies
I bought these so I could hide them everywhere for my fiance to find. At first he thought it was a charming new bit of mine. He thought I only had one or two of these tiny plastic babies. He thought wrong. Hearing his deep exhausted sigh followed by "oh my god" because he has found baby #175 has brought me more joy than I could ever describe. The fear in his eyes when he opens anything because he is expecting a small plastic baby has produced more serotonin than you can imagine. He is a broken man. I have destroyed his hope of living a life free of tiny plastic babies. We will be finding these for the next 70 years. I will purchase these again.
---
3.This review is from: Overhead Rubber Penguin Mask Happy Feet Animal Fancy Dress (Toy)
I wear this mask to sing lullabies to my children. They are terrified of the mask. Whenever they protest about their bed time, or ask for too many sweets, I whip on the mask, and they soon know who is the King Penguin.
---
Review for a set of lockpicks
This popped up on an email from Amazon, lock picking set, interesting, looks fun, so I got it. Took me about 40 minutes to master breaking into the padlock supplied opening it within seconds, my brand new Yale lock on my back door took about 10 minutes to open, cheap padlock on the shed seconds. Next doors shed seconds, in fact, most of the sheds in the area took seconds. That's where the problems started. Up for sentencing next week.
---
4.This review is from: 6' Buddha Maitreya the Christ Copper Meditation Pyramid System for Healing - Polished Copper Connectors with 4 Inch Capstone (Health and Beauty)

This tent was missing its stakes, tarp, and fly cover. I had to cover it in vines and leaves for my camping trip, and I got soaked overnight when it rained. Coincidentally, my hepatitis is gone now
---
Review for a T-Shirt
Slightly heavier than tissue thin. Cannot imagine the alternate universe in which this would be a heavy cotton shirt.

OK, Amazon won't let me post the above review, because Amazon wants me to write at least 20 words and it doesn't want repeated words.

So I have composed a haiku about this shirt.

The bear has thick fur
It does not wear this tee shirt
For fear of freezing

LATER: And by request:

Ice covers the pond, 
A thin transparent window
Is that your nipple?
---
Review for an hour glass
DO NOT FLIP THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN!!!!!!! It takes an hour for the sand to get back in the bottom.
---
5.This review is from: UFO Detector - Internal magnetometer interfaced with microcontroller for 24 hour/7 days a week monitoring for magnetic anomalies that have been reported with many UFO sightings (Electronics)
I don't know if this is a scam or if mine was broken, but it doesn't work and I am still getting abducted by UFO's on a regular basis.

Door Dasher Review
Corey went above and beyond for this order. Not only did he deliver the ordered items with an efficiency too great for this world, he has also had leftover time to save 100 orphans from a burning building, to help an old lady across the street, and helped my wife deliver our baby. Needless to say, Corey is now little Timmy's godfather. Thank you Corey.
---
6.This review is from: Veet for Men Hair Removal Gel Cream 200 ml (Personal Care)

Makes my farts sound louder. The hair must have acted as a interlocking silencer.. I give this the big thumbs up. 5/5
---
Q&A for a metal detector
Question - Would this work for a child
Only if the child contains metal and is not buried too deep
---
7.This review is from: Nexus Silent Wired Mouse SM-8500 (Personal Computers)

My girlfriend and I were on the verge of breaking up because I would keep her awake at night with my constant mouse clicking. NOT ANYMORE! Consider this relationship saved.

This mouse is so silent she will sometimes forget I'm even home and invite her lover over. He's a pretty cool guy.
---
Review for a toilet brush
I don't know how these things have caught on! Absolute agony and quite disgusting to use. Call me old fashioned, but I'm sticking with toilet paper.
---

8.This review is from: Uranium Ore

I purchased this product 4.47 Billion Years ago and when I opened it today, it was half empty.
---
Review for a cheap car battery
MIL came to visit last year. While she was here, her car battery died. Went to WalMart and bought the cheapest battery I could find hoping it wouldn't last too long and maybe leave her stranded somewhere else.

Well, she's been back to visit several times now with the same battery ... my plan backfired. I've since used the same VP battery in both of our cars. They are a good battery.
---
9.This review is from: Accoutrements Horse Head Mask (Toy)

When I turned State's Witness, they didn't have enough money to put me in the Witness Protection Program, so they bought me this mask and gave me a list of suggested places to move. Since then I've lived my life in peace and safety knowing that my old identity is forever obscured by this life- saving item.
---
Review for coffee with more caffeine
I AM DRINKING THIS COFFEE RIGHT NOW AND I CANNOT STOP SHOUTING AND WRITING IN CAPS LOCKS IT IS SO GOOD AND IT IS SUPER CAFFINATED AND PUNCTUATION IS FOR LOSERS THAT LIKE WEAK COFFEE
---
10.This review is from: HDE USB Wall Charger LED Light Up 4 Port Travel A/C Power Adapter Charger Hub With Interchangeable Plug (Wireless Phone Accessory)

My wife and I can now charge all of our devices simultaneously. Now all we fight about is her crippling alcoholism and my unhealthy obsession with Dakota Fanning
---
Review for a taco restaurant
The entire kitchen and wait staff saw an ice cream truck and ran outside, leaving me alone in the restaurant. 10 minutes later they all came back with ice cream cones. I still can't believe this actually happened.
