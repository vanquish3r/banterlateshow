Superstitions around the world 

1. Japan – Don’t stick chopsticks upright in rice
In Japanese culture, sticking chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is only done during funerals as an offering to the dead. Doing it at dinner is like texting death and saying “pull up.” It’s seen as incredibly disrespectful—and if you’re in Japan, don’t be that tourist.

2. Turkey – Chewing gum at night turns into the flesh of the dead
This spooky Turkish superstition warns you not to chew gum after dark. They say it doesn’t stay gum—it becomes rotten flesh. You were chewing Trident… now you’re chewing Trevor. Bon appétit.

3. India – Don’t sweep the house after sunset
Sweeping at night is believed to drive away wealth, success, and even the goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi. So basically, vacuuming after dinner could make you broke. Finally, a solid reason to leave those crumbs till morning.

4. Russia – Don’t shake hands over a threshold
Russians believe the space beneath the doorway is spiritually significant. Shaking hands across it invites arguments or bad luck. If someone offers their hand while standing in the doorway—just slam it shut. Safer that way.

5. Brazil – Never place your purse or wallet on the floor
In Brazil, it’s said that putting your bag on the floor invites poverty. The money literally walks out. So if you’re broke in Brazil, it might be because you disrespected your handbag.

6. Nigeria – Whistling at night invites evil spirits
Nigerian folklore warns against whistling at night because it attracts ghosts, spirits, or even snakes. So if you’re out there whistling a Disney tune after 10 PM, just know—you might be summoning something that doesn’t sing back.

7. South Korea – Sleeping with a fan on can kill you
“Fan Death” is a legit belief in Korea. People think leaving a fan on in a closed room overnight will suck out your oxygen or cause hypothermia. Many fans even come with timers or warnings. It's like your fan is a vampire… but also an electrician.

8. Iceland – Belief in elves and hidden people
Over half of Icelanders believe in “huldufólk,” or hidden people—like elves that live in rocks and hills. Construction projects have even been rerouted to avoid disturbing them. They’re kind of like HOA members, but invisible and magical.

9. Italy – The number 17 is unlucky
The Roman numeral XVII can be rearranged into “VIXI,” which means “I have lived”—implying death. So in Italy, 17 is like the goth kid of numbers. You won’t find it in hotel rooms, airplane rows, or lucky scratch-offs.

10. Philippines – Don’t go straight home after a wake (Pagpag)
After attending a wake, you should stop somewhere else before going home—this is called Pagpag. It keeps spirits from following you back. That pit stop at Jollibee isn’t just for chickenjoy—it’s to shake off ghosts.

11. Thailand – Don’t cut your hair on Wednesdays
Wednesday is considered a holy day for monks, and cutting your hair is disrespectful. Most Thai salons are closed on Wednesdays because of it. So if you’ve got split ends and it’s Wednesday? You wait. Or you face the wrath of Buddha’s barber.

12. USA – Breaking a mirror gives 7 years of bad luck
This dates back to Roman times, when mirrors were believed to hold your soul. Break one, and it’s seven years of being cursed—or worse, dating apps. (Which is like seven years of bad luck, but more expensive.)

13. Spain – Eating 12 grapes at midnight on New Year's Eve
Each grape represents one month of good luck. But you have to eat them in sync with the twelve bell chimes at midnight. It’s like speed dating with fruit—fail, and you might choke away your 2026.

14. Egypt – Don’t open scissors without cutting something
Egyptians believe opening and closing scissors without cutting brings bad luck—or opens portals to the spirit world. And if you leave them open? That’s just asking for drama. You’re not crafting… you’re conjuring.

15. Germany – Never say "Happy Birthday" early
In Germany, wishing someone an early happy birthday is considered tempting fate. The Grim Reaper’s just waiting like, “Oh? You think you’re gonna make it?”

16. China – The number 4 is unlucky
The word for “four” sounds a lot like “death” in Chinese. So hotels and elevators often skip the 4th floor. It's like the floor exists… but you just don’t talk about it. Basically, 4 is Voldemort.

17. Lithuania – Whistling indoors brings bad luck
It’s believed to summon evil spirits, and even the devil himself. So if you're whistling while you work in Lithuania, someone might throw holy water on you.

18. Vietnam – Avoid washing your hair on Lunar New Year
If you wash your hair on Vietnamese New Year  Feb 17, 2026, you're washing away your luck. So the first few days of the year might be greasy—but they’re lucky greasy.

19. Ireland – Magpies are omens
Seeing one magpie is bad luck, two is good, and more have different meanings. There's even a rhyme:
One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy Five for silver,Six for gold

20. Haiti – Belief in zombies (real ones)
In Haitian Vodou, zombies are people brought back by magic, usually as a form of punishment or control. It’s not like Hollywood zombies—it’s more like undead community service.
